function practical1

%The aim of practical 1 is to calculate the homography that best maps two
%sets of points to one another.  We will (eventually) use this for creating
%panoramas, and for calculating the 3d pose of planes.  You should use this
%template for your code and fill in the missing sections marked "TO DO"

%set of two dimensional Cartesian points
pts1Cart = [  240.5000   16.8351   33.5890  164.2696  149.1911;...
              248.8770  193.5890   251.3901 168.4581  228.7723];

%turn points to homogeneous representation
pts1Hom = [pts1Cart; ones(1,size(pts1Cart,2))]
      
%define a homography
H = [0.6 0.7 -100; 1.0 0.6 50; 0.001 0.002 1.0]

%apply homography to points
pts2Hom = H*pts1Hom

%convert back to Cartesian
pts2Cart = pts2Hom(1:2,:)./repmat(pts2Hom(3,:),2,1)

%add a small amount of noise
noiseLevel = 4.0;
pts2Cart = pts2Cart+noiseLevel*randn(size(pts2Cart));

%draw two set of two dimensional points
%opens figure
figure; set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]);
%draw lines between each pair of points
nPoint = size(pts1Cart,2)
for (cPoint = 1:nPoint)
    %plot a green line between each pair of points
    plot([pts1Cart(1,cPoint) pts2Cart(1,cPoint)],[pts1Cart(2,cPoint) pts2Cart(2,cPoint)],'g-');
    %make sure we don't replace with next point
    hold on;
end;

%draws first set of points
plot(pts1Cart(1,:),pts1Cart(2,:),'b.','MarkerSize',20);
%remove axis
set(gca,'Box','Off');

%draws second set of points
plot(pts2Cart(1,:),pts2Cart(2,:),'r.','MarkerSize',20);

%now our goal is to transform the first points so that they map to the
%second set of points

%****TO DO****: Fill in the details of this routine 
%At the moment, it just returns and identity matrix (body is below)
HEst = calcBestHomography(pts1Cart, pts2Cart);

%now we will see how well the routine works by applying the mapping and
%measuring the square  distance between the desired and actual positions

%apply homography to points
pts2EstHom = HEst*pts1Hom

%convert back to Cartesian
pts2EstCart = pts2EstHom(1:2,:)./repmat(pts2EstHom(3,:),2,1)

%calculate mean squared distance from actual points
sqDiff = mean(sum((pts2Cart-pts2EstCart).^2))

%draw figure with points before and after
%draw two set of two dimensional points
%opens figure
figure; set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]);
%draw lines between each pair of points
nPoint = size(pts1Cart,2)
for (cPoint = 1:nPoint)
    %plot a green line pairs of actual and estimated points
    plot([pts2Cart(1,cPoint) pts2EstCart(1,cPoint)],[pts2Cart(2,cPoint) pts2EstCart(2,cPoint)],'g-');
    %make sure we don't replace with next point
    hold on;
end;

%draws second set of points
plot(pts2Cart(1,:),pts2Cart(2,:),'r.','MarkerSize',20);
%remove axis
set(gca,'Box','Off');

%draws estimated positions of second set of points
plot(pts2EstCart(1,:),pts2EstCart(2,:),'m.','MarkerSize',20);

%other things **** TO DO ****
%1. Convince yourself that the homography is ambiguous up to scale (by
%multiplying it by a constant factor and showing it does the same thing).
%Can you see why this is mathematically the case?
%2. Show empirically that your homography routine can EXACTLY map any four points to any
%other four points
%3. Now move to practical 1b.




%==========================================================================
function H = calcBestHomography(pts1Cart, pts2Cart)

%should apply direct linear transform (DLT) algorithm to calculate best
%homography that maps the points in pts1Cart to their corresonding matchin in 
%pts2Cart
%****TO DO ****: replace this
%**** TO DO ****;
%first turn points to homogeneous
%then construct A matrix which should be (10 x 9) in size
%solve Ah = 0 by calling
%h = solveAXEqualsZero(A); (you have to write this routine too - see below)
%reshape h into the matrix H
%Beware - when you reshape the (9x1) vector x to the (3x3) shape of a homography, you must make
%sure that it is reshaped with the values going first into the rows.  This
%is not the way that the matlab command reshape works - it goes columns
%first.  In order to resolve this, you can reshape and then take the
%transpose
pts1Cart = [pts1Cart; zeros(1,size(pts1Cart,2))]; 			
pts2Cart = [pts2Cart; zeros(1,size(pts2Cart,2))];
matrixA = zeros(2*size(pts1Cart,2),9);
for i = 1:size(pts1Cart,2)
    a = pts1Cart(1,i);
    b = pts1Cart(2,i);
    c = pts2Cart(1,i);
    d = pts2Cart(2,i);
    matrixA(2*i-1,:) = [0,0,0,-a,-b,-1,d*a,d*b,d];
    matrixA(2*i,:) = [a,b,1,0,0,0,-c*a,-c*b,-c];
end
h = solveAXEqualsZero(matrixA); 
H = reshape(h,[3,3])';

%==========================================================================
function x = solveAXEqualsZero(matrixA)
[~,~,V] = svd(matrixA);
x = V(:,end);
